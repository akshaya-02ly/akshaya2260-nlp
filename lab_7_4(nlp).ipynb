        "### Question 7: Give two real-life applications of text similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text similarity is a fundamental concept in NLP with numerous real-life applications across various domains. Here are two prominent examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Plagiarism Detection**: Text similarity is extensively used in educational institutions and publishing houses to identify instances of plagiarism. By comparing a submitted document (e.g., a student essay, a research paper) against a vast database of existing texts (e.g., academic databases, web content), similarity algorithms can detect passages or entire documents that have been copied or paraphrased without proper attribution. Tools like Turnitin or Grammarly utilize sophisticated text similarity techniques to highlight overlapping content, helping to maintain academic integrity and intellectual property rights.\n",
        "    *   **How it works**: Documents are broken down into smaller units (sentences, paragraphs), converted into numerical representations (e.g., TF-IDF vectors, embeddings), and then compared using metrics like Cosine or Jaccard similarity. High similarity scores between a submitted text and a source text indicate potential plagiarism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Recommendation Systems (Content-Based Filtering)**: Many online platforms use text similarity to power their recommendation engines, particularly in content-based filtering. This involves recommending items to users based on the similarity between the item's description and the user's past preferences or the descriptions of items they have previously liked. Examples include recommending:\n",
        "    *   **Movies/TV Shows**: Based on plot summaries, genres, and tags.\n",
        "    *   **News Articles**: Based on the content of articles a user has read before.\n",
        "    *   **Products**: Based on product descriptions that match items a user has browsed or purchased.\n",
        "    *   **Academic Papers**: Based on abstracts and keywords of papers relevant to a researcher's interests.\n",
        "    *   **How it works**: Text descriptions of items are transformed into numerical vectors. When a user expresses interest in an item, its vector is compared (using cosine similarity, for instance) with the vectors of other available items to find the most similar ones. The items with the highest similarity scores are then recommended to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "These applications demonstrate how quantifying text similarity enables automated systems to process, understand, and leverage textual information to provide valuable services and insights."

        "The analysis revealed that while both Cosine and Jaccard similarity metrics effectively quantify lexical overlap, they struggle to capture semantic relationships when sentences use different words to express similar concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Text data was thoroughly preprocessed using lowercasing, punctuation and number removal, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. This ensured a clean and consistent text representation.\n",
        "*   **Numerical Representation (TF-IDF)**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was chosen over Bag-of-Words to represent text numerically. This choice was justified by TF-IDF's ability to assign weights to words based on their frequency within a document and their uniqueness across the corpus, thus emphasizing distinctive terms and downplaying common ones. The resulting TF-IDF matrix had a shape of (7, 29) for the sample corpus.\n",
        "*   **Cosine Similarity Observations**:\n",
        "    *   Sentences with significant lexical overlap (e.g., \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" and \"A fast brown fox leaps over a sleepy dog.\") showed moderate cosine similarity ($\\text{0.385}$), reflecting shared key terms like \"brown\" and \"fox,\" despite different verbs and adjectives.\n",
        "    *   Sentences with no lexical overlap (e.g., \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" and \"The cat sits on the mat.\") consistently yielded a cosine similarity of $\\text{0.000}$.\n",
        "    *   Crucially, semantically related sentences that lacked direct lexical overlap after preprocessing (e.g., \"Dogs are loyal pets and great companions.\" vs. \"Felines are often kept as domestic animals.\"; or \"The weather today is sunny and warm.\" vs. \"It is a beautiful and hot day outside.\") also resulted in a cosine similarity of $\\text{0.000}$. This highlights a limitation of TF-IDF in capturing semantic relationships beyond exact word matches.\n",
        "*   **Jaccard Similarity Observations**: Jaccard similarity was computed based on the ratio of common unique tokens to total unique tokens. As expected, it also measures lexical overlap, providing similar insights into word-level commonalities as cosine similarity, without inherently capturing deeper semantic meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Enhance Semantic Understanding**: The current methods (TF-IDF with Cosine/Jaccard) are limited in capturing semantic similarity. To address this, explore advanced techniques like Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) or contextual embeddings (BERT, GPT) that can represent words and sentences in a way that captures their contextual meaning, enabling better similarity detection for semantically related but lexically distinct texts.\n",
        "*   **Contextualize Preprocessing**: While general preprocessing steps were applied, tailoring stopword lists or lemmatization rules to specific domain knowledge could further refine the textual representation and potentially improve similarity results for domain-specific texts.\n"

WordNet-based similarity captures meaning better because it identifies semantic relationships like synonyms between words. Cosine similarity may still give a moderate score even when texts share related words but not exact matches. Jaccard often gives low scores when sentences use different words with similar meanings. WordNet provides higher similarity when synonyms are used, even if exact words differ. Scores disagreed mainly when sentences had similar meaning but different vocabulary. In such cases, Jaccard gave low similarity while WordNet gave higher similarity. Cosine similarity usually lies between Jaccard and WordNet in most comparisons. Therefore, semantic methods like WordNet are better for meaning-based comparison, while lexical methods depend strictly on word overlap.\n",
